# Time-Series-Energy-Demand-Forecasting
In this project, we successfully achieved effective Energy Consumption Prediction by utilizing machine learning models, with a specific focus on the Random Forest Model. Our study was conducted using a comprehensive dataset that encompassed power consumption data for region one, region two, and region three in the city of TÃ©touan. The dataset included various factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, general diffusion rate, and diffusion rate, which were measured at regular intervals of either every 10 minutes or hourly. To determine the most suitable model, we employed various machine-learning techniques and conducted model training and evaluation. Through analyzing their score values, we were able to identify the model that performed the best in accurately predicting energy consumption

Conducted in-depth analysis to understand how daily energy consumption trends vary with seasons.	Successfully derived new attributes through feature engineering, optimizing the dataset for modeling and improving the accuracy of the predictive algorithms with PCA for dimensionality reduction.
Employed various algorithms, including Decision Trees (DT), XG Boost, and RNN to enhance prediction accuracy.
Specialized in Time Series analysis to account for temporal dependencies, resulting in a more accurate prediction model with accuracy of 93%.
Achieved RMSE of 0.8 with time-series modeling using XG-Boost
